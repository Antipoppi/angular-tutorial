# Angular tutorial - Tour of Heroes app
Angular tutorial from their [website](https://angular.io/tutorial) that I did to get familiar with Angular and TypeScript. It was really nice tutorial and now I'm more confident on TypeScript. I had no previous experience with Angular or AngularJS so this was completely new for me. There are also screenshots of the finished app.

This was also my first repository in Github. I was doing the tutorial locally when after part 4 I realised that I could try version controlling in here. I took the opportunity to try things here too and part 6 of the tutorial was made in a separate branch that I merged to the main branch when completed.
